# fet-week-5

This was fun.  Got to create a tic tac toe game.  Had fun working on the design element of the game.  Still need to work out the ending part of the alert, but game functions fine.  Tells who is what marker, who wins, and if there is a tie.  Also doesn't let a player double click or select a spot.  Always taking turns.
